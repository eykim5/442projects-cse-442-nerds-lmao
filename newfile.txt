"Does your team will need a web server to host your project? (If yes, I will work with cse-consult to get it setup for your team).
Does your team will need a database server to be used by your project? (If yes, I will work with cse-consult to get that organized).
Describe your team's alternate dispute resolution approach. This should be a silly, but simple, way to resolve disputes when your team just cannot agree. Voting is NOT allowed for this, but anything else is okay. If When problems arise, we will expect you to use this.
Write 1 or 2 paragraphs describing the completed version of your project. (Developing estimates is very, very hard and takes years to do well. These descriptions are only to help your project manager understand your goals and prioritize the work to be done).
Write 1 or 2 paragraphs describing a typical user of your project and how they would use it."

will fix later.
